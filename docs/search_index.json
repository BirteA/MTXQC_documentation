["2-intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction MTXQCvX documentation 2.1 Structure 2.2 How to use this documentation 2.3 Example datasets and files 2.4 What do I do if I don't find the answer?", " Chapter 2 Introduction MTXQCvX documentation This documentation introduces to you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to run a first straight-forward data analysis of your metabolomics experiment. The underling experimental and mathematical concepts have been introduced for the pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM) approach published in (Pietzke et al. 2014). This documentation shows you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to assess the quality of your GC-MS derived data, perform the determination of calibration curves and absolute quantification. It furthermore provides you two normalisation strategies and the calculation of quantities in, e.g., pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue. MTXQCvX2 does also enable the calculation of stable isotopic incorporation and the evaluation of the underlying data, the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs). The tool has been set up to support the in-lab developed workflow for quantitative metabolomics experiments using the in-house developed software Maui for the annotation of data. MTXQCvX2 bridges the gap between quality control and first data post-processing / analysis of GC-MS derived data (MTXQCvX2_part1, MTXQCvX2_part2). Nevertheless MTXQCvX2 includes a module in order to integrate all kind of data provided in spreadsheet-format, e.g., derived from metmax, extracting required information and creating corresponding files (MTXQCvX2_part4). 2.1 Structure MTXQCvX2 contains a suite of modules is optimized to process GC-MS derived data and processed either in Maui or Chromatof/Metmax. Workflows for both approaches are introduced with step-by-step instructions in chapter @(maui) and @(metmax). Subsequently each MTXQCvX2 module (chapter 6 - 10) is introduced in greater detail including a input / output files and processing parameter. The configuration of MTXQCvX2 has been split into two categories - (1) a general configuration config_files and (2) metabolomics specific parameters config_mtx. Latter one is meant to provide flexibility including further substances. How to do so and what files can be customizes is shown in chapter ??. Workflow-specific processing methods applied in Chromatof are introduced separately in the chapter 12 and 13 including all parameter as well as a short introduction. The remaining chapter cover a chapter for frequently asked questions (chapter14) that might give you a hint where to search for the information you are looking for. The appendix summarises technical reference material in the form of a dictionary of tables (chapter 15), protocols for the pSIRM workflow 16 and a complete distinct chapter listing protocols (chapter 17) including standard and sample preparation and derivatisation (chapter 17.4 and 17.5) and the current setting of the GC-ToF-MS machine (chapter 17.6). 2.2 How to use this documentation This documentation provides for each level the right starting point. Complete newbies are highly suggested to start with one of the two tutorials and following the step-by-step descriptions using the example datasets. Also if you are using for the first time please go through to the chapter once to be aware of all the steps that are required to succeed. Experienced users might be referred to the explanation of the individual modules or to the how-to-guides for data processing and the FAQs section. 2.3 Example datasets and files introduce inst/template folder 2.4 What do I do if I don't find the answer? If you are familiar with github and the create an issue - please head on to the gihub repository (github.com/ChrisZasa/MTXQC_documentation) of this documentation and create one or write me a message.

The dataset represents the data of the first psirm metabolomics experiment in the Kempa Lab. HEK293 cells have been cultivated at 21% oxygen and a range of glucose levels (0.3 - 4.5 g/L Glc) and constant glutamine concentration (4 mM) following standard cell culture procedures. During the cell harvest cells have been labeled for two minutes with uniformly labeled 13C-glucose, three replicates per condition. 3.4 In detail 3.4.1 Setup a R-project R-projects provide a secure environment to handle your data from the processing in MTXQCvX2 until the final reports and analysis. Think about it as a big bubble containing and carrying all your data and analysis savely from one place to the other undisturbed of the outside changes. Open R-studio and create a new project following: File -&gt; New project -&gt; New Project -&gt; New Directory and call the directory tutorial_single_maui and the preferred subdirectory. I recommend to start each project in a new session (tick the box at the bottom of the dialogue box). 3.4.2 Copy MTXQCvX2 template files Download the current version of MTXQCvX2 called fluffy adventure here Open and extract the zip-file Copy all folders and files into your newly created R-project ’tutorial_single_maui` 3.4.3 Process MTXQC_init.Rmd The module MTXQC_init.Rmd provides you two important things: (1) Check-up package installation (2) Creation of project-folder The project folder is supposed to provide a tidy structure while data processing and analysis and contains several pre-defined folder. Besides the following folders: ‘input’, ‘output’ and ‘figures’ you see a detailed subfolder structure. You find more details about each folder and additional suggestion how to use project-folder in chapter 5. All you need to do is to process the MTXQC_init.Rmd. The following procedure is how you process all .Rmd-files of MTXQCvX2: Click on the small black triangle next to the ball of yarn Choose Knit with Parameters... If the .Rmd-file contains defined parameters a shiny dialogue pops up and provides an interactive selection based on the document. In the case of MTXQC_init.Rmd you are asked to define a so-called project-folder, e.g., psirm_glucose. Define the name of the project-folder: psirm_glucose Check in the files tab of R-Studio if you see the new folder and browse through it. 3.4.4 Prepare and copy input files Several files have to be exported from Maui and copied into the folders input/gc, input/quant and input/inc for the evaluation of the GC-MS performance, absolute quantification and isotope incorporation. Please follow the detailed instructions in section 12.3 if you need further information how to perform the export in Maui. For the purpose of the tutorial the exported files are already processed and copied into the corresponding subfolders of the input-folder. 3.4.5 Copy files: annotation.csv and Sample_extracts.csv Both files contain important information about your metabolomics experiment and since these information are highly specific you need to create them on your own and save them in project-folder/input/. Browse to both files in the tutorial dataset, have a look at the content and copy both files into psirm_glucose/input. The herein shown annotation file contains information about the eperimental conditions of each sample and measurement file. The columns File and Type are mandatory, additional columns defining further parameter, like cell line or glucose level, are totally customizable to your needs. The sample extracts file specify the nature and volume / weight of the sample extracts. The columns Extract_vol and Unit are mandatory here. This file here shows cell extracts defined with the unit count for specific conditions. Please be aware that names of experimental conditions have to match between annotation and sample extracts file. Nevertheless it is not necessarily required to define for each combination of conditions a cell count. Please refer FAQs section 14.1 and 14.2 for further information how to create and set up both files from the scretch. 3.4.6 Define an internal standard - cinnamic acid We have to define the internal extraction standard for each experiment in the file config_mtx/conversion_metabolite.csv. Classical pSIRM experiments like the one we are using for this tutorial used cinnamic acid for tracking variations in experimental sample handling. To do so: Open the file: ’config_mtx/conversion_metabolite.csv` Scroll down to the entry Cinnamic acid trans-, 1TMS Verify that InternalStandard is defined in the column Standard Save the file and close it 3.4.7 Process MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.csv We are ready now to start processing the second module of the MTXQCvX2 called the Experimental Setup. In order to faciliate automated data processing throughout MTXQC files and parameters have to be defined beforehand for each project-folder. Defined parameters are saved in the file MTXQC_params.csv inside the project-folder for future reference enabling to move the project-folder independently of the remaining MTXQC-files. A huge advantage for debugging and sharing your project1 Define the following parameter: Define project-folder: psirm_glucose Define input-format: maui Name of annotation file: annotation.csv Name of sample extracts file: sample_extracts.csv Type of experiment: pSIRM Applied 13C-substrates: glc Internal standard: check Type of samples: cell extracts Additional calibration curves: no Integrate add. calibration curves: no Quantification standards: Quant1_v3 Volume polar phase of Quants: 500 Technical replicates2: no Confirm the parameter and file definition and wait a moment. Check if you can find the file MTXQC_params.csvand also Maui_params.csv. Latter one is automatically generated by selecting maui project as input format. Maui_params.csv contains the information of the pre-defined file names containing all required input data. Have a look at the produced pdf-file and check the comments and messages. Throughout MTXQCvX2 messages inform about (1) successfull data imports, (2) fatal errors causing an automatic stop of data processing and (3) warning pointing towards things that should be checked before moving to the next step. 3.4.8 Process MTXQC_part1.Rmd Since we have defined all required input parameter the main document is ready to run after the definition of only three parameter: Definition of the project-folder: psirm_glucose Type of data: maui Manual validated data3 Also here, scroll carefully through the generated pdf-file and have a look at the messages. If all works out it doesn’t matter, but it might help to know what should be written if you end up with an error message instead of. Each generated graphic is going to be explained in detail in chapter 7. For now please refer to my phd thesis (Zasada 2017). All quality metrices are visualised on the last page of the report split into two heatmaps: GC-performance: orange, across all measurements Quantification &amp; isotope incorporation: blue, for each intermediate Besides the generation of the MTXQC_part1 report several csv-files are exported into the output folder summarising statistics of all quality control metrices. The content of each file is summarised in the dictionary of tables (chapter 15). The most important file CalculationFileData.csv summarises all experimental conditions, normalisation factors as well as information about calibration curve parameter and derived quantities. You find this file here - project-folder/output/quant/. It is worth to open this file in a program of your choice and check for a selected intermediate the content. Wrong assignments of conditions in the annotation or sample extracts-file might cause duplication of values, easily to identify if exactly the same peak areas, so the same file, appears multiple times in this file. CalculationFileData.csv is all about the absolute quantities and data normalisation. Why does it not contain information about isotope incorporation you might ask. Well, depending on the experimental setup you might follow different ways how to combine both entities. Furthermore MTXQC_part1 is not about doing any processing of the data in the sense of analysis or statistics.4 The next module has been set up to give you a first quick report about the content of your data performing basic post processing steps. 3.4.9 Process MTXQC_part2.Rmd This module aims to provide you a quick overview of your data. It generates, based on your parameter definition while processing this file, statistics of quantities for each intermediate as well as isotope incorporation and 13C-labeled quantities. A senseful association of your experimental parameter might provide you even ready-to-show plots for a presentation or report. Different color schemes are in place to meet your personal taste - play a bit and find your favorite ;). All kind of outputs (graphics, statistics) are saved at output/quant/... into a day-specific folder5, meaning if you repeat the same analysis several times a day the content is replaced with each run6. Simply modify the folder name to avoid this behaviour. If you go on with your analysis the next or another day a new folder is created. Go and process this module with the following parameter: Project-folder: psirm_glucose Tpye of analysis: stringent Internal standard: QC7 Quantitative value: InstStd_Conc_pmio8 par1: time par2: substrate par3: whatelse Feel free to add further plots at the end of this report if required or define your project specific color code at the beginning of the document. I recommend to use the output of MTXQC_part2.Rmd as a kind of overall visualisation of the data. Specific questions might be addressed in smaller reports using the output-files of MTXQC_part2.Rmd. I furthermore suggest to process both type of analysis - stringent and less stringent - to get an impression at what points the manual validation of distinct intermediates might be useful. 3.5 At the end… So far you have used MTXQCvX2 to generate two reports: (1) one summarising the quality of the generated data and (2) a first statistical overview about the content of your data. With this the tutorial ends and refers to the plenty of detailed information scattered in a number of additional chapters of this documentation. The FAQ section tries to guide you through more specific settings and introduces you to the flexibility of MTXQCvX2. Since every metabolomics experiment has it’s own purpose and reasoning I want to point out, that MTXQCvX2 does not want to provide a magical tool giving the perfect solution for everyone. It rather tries to provide a common platform for discussions, information exchange and inspiration by reducing the time that has to be spend on “the boring part of research”. There is no limit to make MTXQC your own perfect tool writing your own reports and extensions. References "],

Historically, MTXQCvX2 has been developed and optimized for Maui-derived input files. The MTXQCvX2-part4.Rmd functions as a converter of metmax-derived files in order to create suitable input formats for MTXQCvX-part1.Rmd. This module could also be used to convert tables derived from other programs as long as they are stick with the herein described table formats. Mandatory columns are referenced in the text for each kind of input file. The general workflow of the NMTXQCvX2 project is briefly shown below in quick view. More detailed instructions are summarised in the following paragraphs. For more detailed explanations about the individual input parameter for each module of MTXQCvX2 please proceed to read the documentation about the individual modules and their knitting parameter. The relation of knitting parameter, input and output files are described in each section. 4.3 Quick view Generate input files: run MTXQC_part4.Rmd10 Setup R-project and copy MTXQC-files Knit with parameter: MTXQC_init.Rmd Copy input files into corresponding folders Create annotation.csv and sample_extracts.csv files11 Update metabolite names in conversion_metabolite.csv12 Define the internal standard and/or alkanes13 Knit with parameter: MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part1.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part2.Rmd If required - proceed with MTXQC_part3.Rmd for ManualValidation 4.4 Input files If you need an introduction about how to use metmax - have a look at the separate documentation Metmax_intro. The chapter ?? MTXQCvX_part4 explains in detail how to use this module to generate suitable input files. 4.5 Annotation-file The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type - are obligatory and have to be present in the annotation file. In the case of their absence MTXQCvX_part1.Rmd stops processing and shows an error message. A quick way to generate an annotation file is described below: Copy all file names from a file of your choice Paste &amp; transpose the content into a new Excel-File into column A Call column A -&gt; File Optional: Remove any non-file name entry in this column Add the column Type and specify each file either as sample, Q1_diluation, ,addQ1_dilution14 Add more columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment15 Save the content as csv-file in the psirm_glucose/input/... 4.6 Sample_extracts-file The sample_extracts.csv file is required in order to determine automatically absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue in the CalculationFileData.csv. This file requires two obligatory columns - Extract_vol and Unit16. Please specify for each experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue (mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets. The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder psirm_glucose/input/.... If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the annotation MTXQCvX2_part1.Rmd exit data processing. A template file is saved for review and usage at inst/template_files/... 4.7 Update metabolite names in conversion_metabolite.csv The file conversion_metabolite.csv, saved in config_mtx/, serves as a kind of translational table. It defines alternative version of metabolite library names that come in handy to plot data using shorter metabolite names. This file is also used to define settings and standard classifications. Detailed information for each column of the file are shown here: REF 4.7.1 Match your annotation with library names Prior the analysis you need to match the names of your intermediates with the conversion_metabolite.csv file. You need to update or add the corresponding name for each intermediate in the column Metabolite_manual. General suggestion for naming conventions in ChromaToF: Metabolite_Derivate, e.g., Lactic acid_(2TMS). In case of the presence of main- (MP) and byproducts (BP) use: Metabolite_Derivate_MP/BP, e.g., Glucose_(1MEOX)(5TMS)_MP. If you have annotated intermediates that are not included so far in this table please follow the instructions how to extend conversion_metabolite.csv.REF 4.7.2 Define your internal standards and alkanes MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal standards. Corresponding compounds have to be marked as an internal standard in conversion_metabolite.csv by adding the tag InternalStandard in the column Standard. If you check the box - InternalStandard in the parameter selection for MTXQCvX2_part4.Rmd the module searches in your input file for peak areas of the defined standard and extracts the information. It also generates the file InternalStandard.csv and stores it at psirm_glucose/input/gc/.... In the same way alkanes are defined in conversion_metabolite.csv. Each alkane has to be flag tagged with Alk in the column Standard. This gives you the opportunity to implement customized mixtures of alkanes in order to determine the retention index. MTXQCvX_part4.Rmd recognises the flag tag and generates Alcane_intensities.csv based on your input file containing peak areas and saves it in psirm_glucose/input/gc/...17. The in-lab protocol considers nine alkanes from c10 to c36. Standard annotation includes an hashtag, e.g., #c10. If you use this annotation even Metmax would be able to determine the retention index. http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/apps/metmax/default.htm↩ read here the instructions↩ Details further down this document↩ Column: Metabolite_manual↩ Also in conversion_metabolite.csv; see below paragraph Standards↩ see for further details additionalQuant↩ optimal: two-three parameter, max: four parameter.

The header of metmax-extracted files looks like shown below (see table 1). Please, remember to delete the second header row, representing the column loads for each file before saving as csv-file. Otherwise you end up with weird imported dataframes in R. Quantification masses have to be updated while processing in ChromaToF prior the export of the data e.g., with a reference search19 or using statistical compare. pSIRM experiments require the definition of pTop5 masses20 instead of top5 masses in the reference in order to take into account the shift of intensities induced by the application of stable isotopes21 name mass ri row.load file_1 file_2 file_x Lac 219 1051 0.76 15423 135444 465486 Pyr 174 1042 0.65 56978 46888 4354544 Cit 273 1805 0.99 1326 23321 132121 MTXQCvX_part4 takes care of the formatting and correct column names of the peak areas file and saves it22.

Fragments for each intermediate have to be pre-defined in metmax at Tools/Options/metabolite masses. They can be imported26 or manually specified each by each. An example of the metmax output is shown in table 2.

The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type - are obligatory and have to be present in the annotation file. In the case of their absence MTXQCvX_part1.Rmd stops processing and shows an error message. A quick way to generate an annotation file is described below: 1. Copy the first row / header of quantMassAreaMatrix.csv file 2. Paste &amp; transpose the content into a new Excel-File into column A 3. Change the first entry: Metabolite -&gt; File 4. Remove the entry QuantMasses at the very end of the column A 5. Add the column Type and specify each file either as sample, Q1_dilution or addQ1_dilution33 6. Add more columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment34 7. Save the content as csv-file in, e.g., psirm_glucose/input/... 14.2 How do I create the file sample_extracts.csv? The sample_extracts.csv file is required in order to determine automatically absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue in the CalculationFileData.csv. This file requires two obligatory columns - Extract_vol and Unit35. Please specify for each experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue (mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets. The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder psirm_glucose/input/.... If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the annotation MTXQCvX2_part1.Rmd exit data processing. A template file is saved for review and usage at inst/template_files/... 14.3 How do I define an internal extraction standard other than cinnamic acid? MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal extraction standards. The only thing you need to do is to define the corresponding compounds as an internal standard in the config_mtx/conversion_metabolite.csv file. To do so, add to the compound in last column Standard the entry InternalStandard. The definition of an internal standard requires the file ‘InternalStandard.csv’ in the folder input/gc since it is used for the evaluation of normalisation factors in MTXQC_part1. Scenario 1 Maui-project and Cinnamic acid For an classical pSIRM experiment in the Kempa lab we are using cinnamic acid. The evaluation of this compound has been integrated into Maui. Peak areas of cinnamic acid are exported from the container called cinAcid. The exported file36 has to be renamed to InternalStandard.csv though and moved to psirm_glucose/input/gc/.... Scenario 2 Maui-project and different internal standard If you have used a different compound as an internal extraction standard you might need to extract the peak areas of this compound from the file quantPeakAreasMatrix.csv and save it in the folder psirm_glucose/input/gc/InternalStandard.csv, respectively. Prerequisite here - you have annotated the compound in your Maui-project. Scenario 3 Metmax-project In the case you used metmax the module MTXQC_part4.Rmd takes care for you of the generation of the InternalStandard.csv based on the definition in conversion_metabolite.csv and provided peak areas37. This procedure is independent what standard you have defined. It only requires the annotation of your compound in chromtof and successful export with metmax. 14.4 How do I combine multiple MAUI-projects into a single MTXQC-project? Certain circumstances might wish you to combine multiple MAUI-projects into one MTXQC-project. This might be the case when you run the same samples in split and splitless mode on the machine or your experimental setup has been measured in multiple batches in order to avoid derivatisation effects. It is highly recommended to combine the input files derived from a different Maui projects beforehand the analysis. In that way you have only to work with a single file CalculationFileData.csv38 containing all data of the your experiment. The herein described process provides a quick way how to combine the exported files from different Maui projects. The script combine-sets.R39 automatically saves all combined files into the correct input folder. Just update the folder and subfolder names. All the rest has been taken care of for you. Create in the MTXQC-project folder (e.g., psirm_glucose/) a new folder called raw-data Create a subfolder for each Maui-project in psirm_glucose/raw_data/... Copy into this folder all your Maui-derived input files altogether Update the parameter of combine-sets.R, meaning folder name definitions, file Execute the R script Merged files have been generated and copied into the corresponding folder: psirm_glucose/input-folder/gc/... or psirm_glucose/input-folder/inc/...

["16-psirm.html", "Chapter 16 Appendix - pSIRM experiments 16.1 Experimental design 16.2 Experimental procedures 16.3 Protocol pSIRM 16.4 Hints &amp; notes", " Chapter 16 Appendix - pSIRM experiments The application of stable isotopes provides a powerful tool to track the activity of metabolic pathways. the time-dependent and atom-specific routing along a metabolic pathway resolved how substrates like glucose or glutamine are used in order to maintain a certain phenotype and energetic homeostatsis. We developed an approach called pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM) enabling the quantitative evaluation of metabolite pool sizes and incorporation of stable isotopes, e.g., \\(^{13}C_6\\)-glucose. A thoughtful setup of the experimental design including the applied substrates and carefull experimental handling are prerequisites for a successful pSIRM experiment. Essential aspects are collected in the below paragraphs along with a number of usefull tweaks. 16.1 Experimental design An in vitro pSIRM experiment lasts in total up to three days starting from the cell seeding at day zero. Further along the way up to two media changes should be included until the application of stable isotopes and harvesting the cells maintaining the continouse availability of nutrients and avoiding the accumulation of waste products (Figure (fig:psirm)). The media change four hours prior the harvest is set up in order to give cells time to recover from the mechanical stress of the media change. At the time point of harvest cells should be in a perfect happily state regarding metabolic environment and stress. Choose carefully the seeding density of you cells in the first place. High confluency inducing contact inhibition of cell growth has a strong impact on several cellular processes including the uptake of nutrients. Try to aim for petri dishes with a maximum confluency of 75-80 %. A pre-experiment including different cell densities for seeding at a number of experimental conditions helps you to get a feeling for the cell growth in general and an expected output of cells at the time point of the harvest. Later one is useful to plan sample extraction and measurement subsequently. Figure 16.1: Experimental design of a pSIRM experiment distuingishing short and long labeling with stable isotopes. For adherent cell cultures only: Include for each experimental condition an additional petri dish that is solely used to determine the cell count at the time point of your harvest. This additional plate ensures a correct determination of absolute quantities and might reduce variation of pool sizes in the statistical analysis40. Think carefully about control conditions and include cell culture dishes that are not labeled. These dishes function as a control for your labeling procedure and the natural abundance of isotopes. 16.2 Experimental procedures There is a slight difference in the protocols for adherent and suspension cells. Please read instructions and footnotes carefully. Short41 and long term labeling procured differ only in the applied solvents during the labeling - either label buffer (LB) only or a combination of full label medium (LM) and label buffer (LB). Latter one is applied in order to remove extracellular metabolites of the media. Both label buffer and media contain the major nutrients / stable isotopes to keep the main substrates at constant supply at all times (Table 16.1). During the application of stable isotopes longer than a few minutes cells might sense the absence of further intermediates provided during standard cell culture procedure and and adjust their metabolic program accordingly. Table 16.1: Solvent composition of Full label medium (LM) and label buffer (BF) for a pSIRM experiment labeling with 13C-glucose. Solvent Base Carbon.source Supplements Full label medium (LM) DMEM, without glucose, glutamine, pyruvate 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L) 12C-Gln (2 mM) small molecules (inhibitor, antibiotics) Label buffer (LB) HEPES (5 mM), NaCl (140 mM), pH 7.4 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L) 12C-Gln (2 mM) The quality of your data later heavily relies on the exact handling of the cells and a consistent timing throughout the pSIRM experiment. Especially the step removing the LB and quenching the cells should be a matter of a tenth of seconds rather than seconds. It is of great value to perform the cell harvest with a second person. 16.3 Protocol pSIRM 16.3.1 Adherent cell cultures The herein described protocols are detailed explanations how to perform a pSIRM cell harvest for long term label application. If you want to label for less than 2 minutes omit solely omit steps 6-8. Materials: Cell culture dishes, max. confluency 80 % Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates (5 ml / dish)42 Label buffer (LB) supplemented with substrates (5 ml / dish) Ice-cold 50 % MeOH supplemented with 2 ug/ul cinnamic acid 2x 5 ml pipette and tips43 Beaker Ice 15 ml falcons (chloroform resistant) Cell lifter Biological waste bin next to your bench Procedure: Pre-warm LB and LM in the water bath Take a number of petri dishes (condition-wise including all biol. replicates) Discard cell culture media Carefully add long term labeling LM OR short term labeling: LB Incubate cells on the bench or in an incubator Discard LM (beaker) Add immediatly 5 ml of LB Rotate dish once in order to cover complete surface Meanwhile 2nd person get prepared with 5 ml ice-cold MeOH Discard LB into beaker and immediatly 2nd person quenches with ice-cold MeOH Collect cell extracts using cell lifter Transfer cell extracts into 15 ml falcons Store falcons on ice until further processing Repeat this procedure (step 6-10) for all dishes of a single condition first. Once MeOH is added metabolic processes are interrupted and cell extracts can be collected with the help of cell lifter without rush and subsequently transfered to 15 ml falcon and stored on ice until further processing (see chapter Cell extraction methanolic extracts). Determine the cell count using your additional petri dishes for each condition. 16.3.2 Supension cell cultures Materials: Cell culture flasks Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates 5 ml pipette and tips44 1 ml pipette Beaker paper tissues Liquid nitrogen 15 ml falcons 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes Biological waste bin next to your bench Procedure: Pre-warm LM in the water bath Determine the cell count of your cell suspension(s) Take aliquots of \\(10-15e+6\\) cells and transfer into 15 ml falcon Spin down cells very gently 300 g, 2 min at room temperature Discard media into beaker Resuspend cells gently in three-times 1 ml45 Incubate and keep warm Fractionate cell supension in three eppendorf tubes (3x 1 ml each) Spin down quickly in top-bench centrifuge46 Discard media blandtly on paper tissues Snap-freeze immediatly in liquid nitrogen Store cells until further processing (see chapter Cell extraction suspension cells) The important step here to be quick is the alquotation of the cell suspension and subsequent spin down in the table centrifuge. Suspension cells are rather small, nevertheless \\(3e+6\\) cells per extract are a good starting point for GC-MS measurements. 16.4 Hints &amp; notes The only way to be reproducible and fast is to team up with a second person. Keep timing consistently through the experiment. Keep substrate concentrations constant throughout the experiment in all solutions. Supplement one stable isotopic labeled substrate with all remaining substrates in non-labeled form. Think about nutrient levels in your cell culture and your experimental conditions. Maybe you want to change things to physiological levels. Add additional plate to each condition in order to have material for western blotting and others. Check carefully the confluency of your dishes and determine seeding densities for different conditions. In case of small molecule inhibitors: Try to avoid to solve them in DMSO - strong impact on chromatography. Pelleting these cells and snap-freezing might give usefull additional samples for western blotting.↩ I would rather recommend this up to 2 min of labeling↩ Not required for short term labeling↩ Highly recommended, makes labeling and harvest super quick↩ Highly recommended, makes labeling and harvest super quick↩ To generate three replicates↩ Most of the times 30 s are already enough↩ "],
