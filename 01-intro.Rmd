# Content of MTXQCvX documentation {#intro}

This documentation introduces to you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to run a first straight-forward data analysis of your metabolomics experiment. Experimental and mathematical concepts have been introduced for the pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM) approach published in [@Pietzke2014].

MTXQCvX2 contains a suite of modules is optimized to process GC-MS derived data and processed either in Maui or Chromatof/Metmax. Workflows for both approaches are introduced with step-by-step instructions in chapter @\ref(maui) and @\ref(metmax).

Subsequently each MTXQCvX2 module (chapter \@ref(ExpSetup) - \@ref(Metmax)) is introduced in greater detail including a input / output files and processing parameter.

The configuration of MTXQCvX2 has been split into two categories - (1) a general configuration `config_files` and (2) metabolomics specific parameters `config_mtx`. Latter one is meant to provide flexibility including further substances. How to do so and what files can be customizes is shown in chapter \@ref(config).

Protocols of sample preparation and measurement are summarised in the following chapters \@ref(SamplePrep) and \@ref(GCMS). Workflow-specific processing methods applied Chromatof are introduced separately in the chapter \@ref(mauiproc) and \@ref(metmaxproc) including all parameter.

The remaining chapter cover a chapter for frequently asked questions (chapter\@ref(FAQ)) and the visualisation of all tables (chapter \@ref(tables)).
